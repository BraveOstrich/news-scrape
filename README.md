# news-scrape

The site is not functional at this time. I am getting an "Article validation failed" error that I need to figure out, then I will get the buttons working and check the comments.

The News Scrape App is using a Mongo Database, Mongoose, Express, Express Handlebars, Cheerio, and Axios. The page will scrape a news site for articles, display them on the page and allows visitors to leave comments on articles.

I am submitting the incomplete assignment so it is not late, and will continue to debug the app, and repost once that is complete.
